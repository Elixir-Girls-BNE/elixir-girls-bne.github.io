            <p>Welcome to Elixir Girls. These guides have been developed by our fantastic community of volunteer mentors, some of whom you will meet today. These guides are designed to make learning to develop with Elixir more approachable and to help build a diverse and inclusive Elixir community. Get started by choosing the install guide for your operating system from the left hand navigation.</p>
